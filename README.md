# mockRandJSON
MockRandJSON is a plugin for jQuery that can hijack JSON and JSONP requests and respond with randomly generated JSON data.

Based on https://github.com/mennovanslooten/mockJSON

This repo separates out jQuery reference which not needed to generate json. 
Another layer can convert ajax requests to generated results
